analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (46,46.0,46) frames.
At utterance begin, あ_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (46,46.0,46) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,25.0,25) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 66.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (32,39.0,32) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,25.0,25) frames.
Overall, あ_S accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (46,46.0,46) frames.
Overall, わ_S accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (32,32.0,32) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 24.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 31.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
