analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,34.0,34) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
At utterance end, あ_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 66.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,6.8,10) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,48.0,36) frames.
Overall, あ_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, い_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,9.0,9) frames.
Overall, お_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,13.0,13) frames.
Overall, し_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, な_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,10.0,10) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 77.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 80.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 74.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 28.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (36,55.0,36)
