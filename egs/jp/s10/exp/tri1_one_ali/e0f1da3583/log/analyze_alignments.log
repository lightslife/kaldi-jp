analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.

At utterance begin, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (78,78.0,78) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
At utterance end, た_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (53,65.5,53) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (161,161.0,161) frames.
Overall, た_S accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 54.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 72.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 75.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 50.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (161,161.0,161)
