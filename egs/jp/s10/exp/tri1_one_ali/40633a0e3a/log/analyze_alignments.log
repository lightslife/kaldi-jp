At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,23.0,23) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (41,41.0,41) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 71.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,19.2,23) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,32.0,23) frames.
Overall, す_S accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,22.0,19) frames.
Overall, が_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,23.0,23) frames.
Overall, で_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.0,14) frames.
Overall, ね_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,15.0,15) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 40.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 60.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
