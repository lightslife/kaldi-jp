At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (65,65.0,65) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (68,68.0,68) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 66.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,11.0,18) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,48.3,65) frames.
Overall, あ_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
Overall, い_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
Overall, お_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.0,14) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, し_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,18.0,18) frames.
Overall, な_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,19.0,19) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 68.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 37.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 15.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 14.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,12.0,12)
