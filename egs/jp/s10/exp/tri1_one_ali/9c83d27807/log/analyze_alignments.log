analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (86,86.0,86) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (86,89.0,86) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,46.5,8) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,34.0,34) frames.
Overall, „Å≠_S accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,34.0,34) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 58.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 69.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 43.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 33.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (86,92.0,86)
