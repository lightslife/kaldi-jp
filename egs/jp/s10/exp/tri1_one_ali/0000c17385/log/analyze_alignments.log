At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (35,35.0,35) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 57.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (32,42.0,35) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 42.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,5.7,5) frames.
Overall, あ_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
Overall, お_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,9.0,9) frames.
Overall, な_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 90.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 68.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 86.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 40.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (32,54.5,32)
