analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (81,81.0,81) frames.
At utterance end, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (201,201.0,201) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,48.0,15) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,104.5,8) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 31.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 7.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 65.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 50.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (15,15.0,15)
