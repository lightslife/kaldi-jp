At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,26.0,26) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,26.0,26) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,33.0,26) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (90,97.5,90) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,11.0,11) frames.
Overall, „Åü_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,11.0,11) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 32.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 83.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 18.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 25.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (26,47.0,26)
