At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (56,56.0,56) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,28.2,42) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,5.0,6) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,54.0,18) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 8.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, し_S accounts for 8.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, た_S accounts for 8.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
Overall, ん_S accounts for 8.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 56.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 79.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 45.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 40.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (22,27.0,29)
