At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 54.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,8.8,11) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 45.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,26.4,24) frames.
Overall, あ_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
Overall, い_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
Overall, お_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,11.0,11) frames.
Overall, し_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, な_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,7.0,7) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 71.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 74.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 61.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 33.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (10,28.0,23)
