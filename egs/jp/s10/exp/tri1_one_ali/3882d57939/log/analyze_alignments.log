At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,16.0,16) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,23.0,23) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,9.2,15) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,22.0,23) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (38,90.0,38) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, し_S accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, た_S accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,15.0,15) frames.
Overall, ん_S accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,16.0,16) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 28.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 87.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 18.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 25.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (16,24.5,16)
