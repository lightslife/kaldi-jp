analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,34.0,34) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,34.0,34) frames.
At utterance end, ね_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,34.0,34) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,58.3,40) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,48.0,7) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,34.0,34) frames.
Overall, ね_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,34.0,34) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 57.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 77.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 59.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 50.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (40,70.5,40)
