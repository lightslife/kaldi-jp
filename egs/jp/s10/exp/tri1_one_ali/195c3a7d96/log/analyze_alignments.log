At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,28.0,28) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (175,175.0,175) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 60.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,71.3,28) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (70,70.0,70) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (21,21.0,21) frames.
Overall, „Åß_S accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (70,70.0,70) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 70.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 33.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 10.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 33.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,11.0,11)
