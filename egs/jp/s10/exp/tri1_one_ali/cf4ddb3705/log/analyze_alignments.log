At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (104,104.0,104) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (75,75.0,75) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 60.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,64.0,75) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,9.5,6) frames.
Overall, じ_S accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,13.0,13) frames.
Overall, ま_S accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 91.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 15.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 40.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 33.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,13.0,13)
