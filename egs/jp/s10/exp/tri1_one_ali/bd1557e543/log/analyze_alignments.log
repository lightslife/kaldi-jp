At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (44,44.0,44) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (78,78.0,78) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 57.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (48,58.0,62) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,12.5,5) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (48,48.0,48) frames.
Overall, „Å≠_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (48,48.0,48) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 76.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 60.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 60.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 40.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (48,55.0,48)
