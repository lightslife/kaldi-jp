analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (36,36.0,36) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
At utterance end, よ_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 75.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,21.2,33) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,29.0,22) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,16.0,16) frames.
Overall, が_S accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,17.0,17) frames.
Overall, だ_S accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (33,33.0,33) frames.
Overall, っ_S accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,18.0,18) frames.
Overall, よ_S accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
Overall, り_S accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (35,35.0,35) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 31.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 76.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 15.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 16.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (22,22.0,22)
