At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,34.0,34) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (86,86.0,86) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,54.3,43) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (67,68.5,67) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
Overall, „Å≠_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 53.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 60.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 23.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 25.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (34,43.0,34)
