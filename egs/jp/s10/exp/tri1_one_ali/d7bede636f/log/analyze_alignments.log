At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (77,77.0,77) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (97,97.0,97) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 57.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (59,67.2,77) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,8.0,3) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,20.0,20) frames.
Overall, だ_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,13.0,13) frames.
Overall, よ_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 88.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 43.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 72.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 40.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (36,47.5,36)
