analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,22.0,22) frames.
At utterance end, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (42,42.0,42) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 60.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,83.0,42) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,24.0,11) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 16.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 78.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 20.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 66.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,24.0,11)
