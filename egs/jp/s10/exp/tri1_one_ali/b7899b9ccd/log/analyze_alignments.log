At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.0,14) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (51,51.0,51) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 57.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (29,36.5,51) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,67.5,7) frames.

Overall, „Åü_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,16.0,16) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 49.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 78.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 34.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 40.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (29,40.5,29)
