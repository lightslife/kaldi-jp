At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (70,70.0,70) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,17.0,17) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 57.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (70,72.8,86) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,5.0,4) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, „Å≠_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 95.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 71.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 93.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 40.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (86,102.0,86)
