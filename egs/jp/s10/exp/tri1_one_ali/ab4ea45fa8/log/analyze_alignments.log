At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (74,74.0,74) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (47,47.0,47) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 66.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (47,60.5,47) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (31,31.0,31) frames.
Overall, い_S accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (31,31.0,31) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 79.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 20.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
