At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (30,30.0,30) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (109,109.0,109) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,48.7,30) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,56.5,23) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (38,38.0,38) frames.
Overall, „Å≠_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (38,38.0,38) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 49.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 53.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 4.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 25.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (7,7.0,7)
