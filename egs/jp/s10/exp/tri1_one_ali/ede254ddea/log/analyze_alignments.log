At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (67,67.0,67) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (37,37.0,37) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 60.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,41.3,37) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (57,86.5,57) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 41.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 65.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 10.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 33.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,20.0,20)
