At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (101,101.0,101) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (53,53.0,53) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 57.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (53,63.8,61) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.5,3) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (35,35.0,35) frames.
Overall, だ_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, よ_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 85.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 48.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 70.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 40.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (40,50.5,40)
