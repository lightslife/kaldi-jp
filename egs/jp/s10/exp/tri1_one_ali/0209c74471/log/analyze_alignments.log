At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,12.0,12) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,34.0,34) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 77.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,18.3,24) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 22.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,23.0,12) frames.
Overall, い_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (38,38.0,38) frames.
Overall, く_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
Overall, な_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,18.0,18) frames.
Overall, よ_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.0,14) frames.
Overall, わ_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
Overall, ん_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,20.0,20) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 26.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 73.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
