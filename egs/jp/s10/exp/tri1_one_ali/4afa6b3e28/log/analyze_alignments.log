analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (29,29.0,29) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,11.0,11) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,9.0,7) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,11.0,11) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (29,29.0,29) frames.
Overall, „Å≠_S accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,11.0,11) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 31.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 31.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 38.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 50.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (7,7.0,7)
