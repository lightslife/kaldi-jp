analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (43,43.0,43) frames.
At utterance begin, お_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (43,43.0,43) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (60,60.0,60) frames.
At utterance end, あ_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (60,60.0,60) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,28.5,43) frames.
Overall, あ_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (60,60.0,60) frames.
Overall, い_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
Overall, お_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (43,43.0,43) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,19.0,19) frames.
Overall, し_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,15.0,15) frames.
Overall, な_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,10.0,10) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 0.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 39.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
