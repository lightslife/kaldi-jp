analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (82,82.0,82) frames.
At utterance end, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (157,157.0,157) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 60.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,91.0,82) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,12.0,9) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 8.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 19.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 41.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 66.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (9,12.0,9)
