At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,28.0,28) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 54.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,11.5,17) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 45.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,18.2,21) frames.
Overall, あ_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, い_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (21,21.0,21) frames.
Overall, お_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,12.0,12) frames.
Overall, し_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,13.0,13) frames.
Overall, な_S accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,17.0,17) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 56.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 77.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 44.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 33.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,18.3,20)
