analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
At utterance begin, あ_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
At utterance end, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,22.0,22) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 42.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,19.0,13) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,52.5,22) frames.
Overall, あ_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, く_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, ん_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 25.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 83.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 29.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 40.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,19.0,13)
