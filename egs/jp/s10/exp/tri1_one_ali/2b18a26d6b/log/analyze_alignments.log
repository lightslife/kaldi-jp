At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (78,78.0,78) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,9.0,9) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,4.5,4) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,35.2,46) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,69.0,28) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, し_S accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
Overall, た_S accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, ん_S accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 47.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 70.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 25.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 25.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (8,27.0,8)
