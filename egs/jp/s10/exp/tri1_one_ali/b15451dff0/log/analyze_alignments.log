At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (46,46.0,46) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (82,82.0,82) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 57.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (54,69.8,82) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,9.0,4) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
Overall, „Å≠_S accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 91.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 58.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 85.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 40.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (54,75.5,54)
