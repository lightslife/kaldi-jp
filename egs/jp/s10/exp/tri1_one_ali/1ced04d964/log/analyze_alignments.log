At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,26.0,26) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 57.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (33,37.5,44) frames.

The optional-silence phone sil occupies 50.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 75.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 34.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 40.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (33,38.5,33)
