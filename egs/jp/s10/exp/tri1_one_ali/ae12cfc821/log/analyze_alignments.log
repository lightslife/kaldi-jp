analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (117,117.0,117) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 60.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,57.3,7) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,62.5,8) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 42.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 59.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 4.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 33.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (8,8.0,8)
