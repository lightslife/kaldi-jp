analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (114,114.0,114) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (45,79.5,45) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,73.0,24) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 52.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 54.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 26.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 50.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (45,45.0,45)
