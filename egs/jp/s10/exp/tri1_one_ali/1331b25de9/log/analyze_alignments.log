At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,15.0,15) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (97,97.0,97) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,43.7,19) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,74.5,3) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,25.0,25) frames.
Overall, „Å≠_S accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,25.0,25) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 43.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 63.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 9.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 25.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (15,19.0,15)
