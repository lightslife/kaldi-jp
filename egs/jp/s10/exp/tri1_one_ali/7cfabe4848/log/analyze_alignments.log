At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,23.0,23) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,28.0,28) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 66.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,16.5,23) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,20.3,23) frames.
Overall, す_S accounts for 22.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,22.0,19) frames.
Overall, あ_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, が_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,23.0,23) frames.
Overall, で_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.0,14) frames.
Overall, ね_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,15.0,15) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 38.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 68.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 9.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 14.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (10,10.0,10)
