analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (60,60.0,60) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (74,74.0,74) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 44.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,6.0,8) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,36.3,32) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 22.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (60,86.0,60) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
Overall, し_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, た_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
Overall, ん_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 35.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 56.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 20.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 28.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (3,17.5,3)
