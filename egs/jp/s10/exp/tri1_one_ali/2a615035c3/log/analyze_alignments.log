At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,20.0,20) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (33,33.0,33) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 55.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,28.2,33) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,53.3,25) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, ã‚ˆ_S accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 46.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 82.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 34.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 42.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (15,29.3,16)
