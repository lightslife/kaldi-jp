analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (33,33.0,33) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (60,60.0,60) frames.
At utterance end, あ_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (60,60.0,60) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 62.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,21.6,25) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 37.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,21.0,20) frames.
Overall, あ_S accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (60,60.0,60) frames.
Overall, い_S accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,25.0,25) frames.
Overall, か_S accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
Overall, し_S accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,7.0,7) frames.
Overall, な_S accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,11.0,11) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 36.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 45.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 38.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 33.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (10,15.0,10)
