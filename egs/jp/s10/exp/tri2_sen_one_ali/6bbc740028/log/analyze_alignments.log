At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (65,65.0,65) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (70,70.0,70) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (32,38.0,32) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (65,67.5,65) frames.
Overall, じ_S accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (44,44.0,44) frames.
Overall, ま_S accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (32,32.0,32) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 64.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 36.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
